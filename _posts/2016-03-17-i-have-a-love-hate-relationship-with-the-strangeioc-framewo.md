I have a love-hate relationship with the StrangeIOC framework. Mostly in that I love the _idea _of it, but I _hate _the dependency chain of knowledge that one has to traverse to truly grok it. A bit of background, first. I've been fixated on the idea of utilizing MVC as a way of future-proofing a codebase which will inevitably be overhauled and redesigned.
